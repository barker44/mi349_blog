        <p>As fall has come around, I've had a weird obsession with pumpkin and pumpkin flavored items. I was never against pumpkin before, in fact, pumpkin is my favorite kind of pie. But, I've never been one for the pumpkin spiced lattes or pumpkin flavored muffins, etc. Something in my brain clicked this year though, and I've just been obsessed with pumpkin flavored things since early September. So far, I've bought pumpkin cream cheese bites, mini pumpkin pies, pumpkin pie flavored kitkats, pumpkin cream cheese muffins, and even pumpkin pie flavored greek yogurt! It's been absurd but no matter how many pumpkin flavored things I eat I still cannot seem to curb the craving for it. I hope I can curb the craving soon, because Christmas is just around the corner (which is terrifying) and I have to get prepared for all of the festive treats around then!</p>

        <p>I have been incredibly lucky in that most of the time that I've been in college, I have not had to worry about working or making an income to support myself. This year, however, I decided to pick up a job during the school year so that way I wouldn't be entirely draining my savings and have some extra cash that I could spend! I'm lucky in that I really do not work that many hours, and the money that I make is really just for extra cash, but somehow it has still been mentally hard for me to balance everything. I have struggled with time management issues in the past, and this job has not helped, even though I work a job where I can do homework while working! I overthink things a lot and stress myself out instead of actually being proactive and doing my assignments, which is something I hope to beat soon as this struggle is incredibly draining. My workplace overall is quite nice though, and the job itself isn't all that hard, it's just balancing my time between everything is the hard part.</p>
